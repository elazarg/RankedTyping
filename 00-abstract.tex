Path-insensitive analyses are cheap but routinely lose precision at control-flow joins, collapsing distinct types to a single “unknown.” We make that loss explicit and quantifiable. We introduce a ranked algebra of types where base types and \textsf{Any} carry a nonnegative rank $i$ (written $X^{i}$ and $\Any^{i}$). Ranks increase only when the analysis \emph{commits to a base after imprecision}, via the subtyping step $\Any^{i}\!\le\!X^{\,i+1}$; heterogeneous joins are conservative (after promotion to a common rank $r$, $X^{r}\sqcup Y^{r}=\Any^{r}$). The result is a small, compositional account of where assumptions were forced and how many such assumptions a value carries.

We instantiate the domain in a conventional abstract interpreter for a while-language. Transfer functions are monotone; joins are associative/commutative/idempotent; and, although the global order has infinite height, each program inhabits a finite slice (rank can rise only at finitely many sites), so fixed-point iteration converges without widening. The analysis is a sound may-analysis: it does not prevent runtime type errors; it records and localizes imprecision. A lightweight ghost-state instrumentation yields \emph{bounded blame}: any runtime type fault is attributable to a small, computed set of program sites.

Conceptually, this is an ``unfolded'' view of gradual typing: standard gradual typing is recovered by collapsing ranks ($X^{i}\mapsto X$, $\Any^{i}\mapsto ?$) and adding consistency/casts. We also sketch conservative extensions (rank-parametric function signatures, graded effects, SSA \(\phi\)-site instrumentation) that reuse the same algebra. The core requires no language changes and no runtime checks.
