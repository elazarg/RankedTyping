\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

We introduced a small, compositional static analysis that makes path-insensitive precision loss explicit via a ranked algebra of types. Base types and $\Any$ carry a nonnegative rank; same-rank heterogeneous joins are conservative, and ranks increase only when the analysis commits to a base after imprecision ($\Any^{i}\!\le\!X^{\,i+1}$). We instantiated this domain in a standard abstract interpreter for a \textsf{while}-language, proved monotonicity and soundness (as a may-analysis), and explained termination either by a simple rank-capping widening or by a finite ghost-set product domain. The rank and its associated culprit-set provide actionable diagnostics: they localize where assumptions were forced and bound how much imprecision a value carries.

The approach is deliberately cast-free and leaves operational semantics unchanged. It relates cleanly to gradual typing: collapsing ranks and adding consistency/casts recovers a conventional gradual system, while retaining the ranked domain yields an ``unfolded'' static account of imprecision provenance. Extensions—rank-parametric function signatures, rank-as-effect grades, shape-preserving joins, SSA $\phi$-site instrumentation, and a gradual mode—fit without disturbing the core algebra.

Limitations are clear: the analysis is path-insensitive, does not guarantee absence of runtime type errors, and we have not attempted an empirical evaluation here. The \S\ref{sec:future} agenda outlines next steps (graded semantics, precision recovery, mechanization). The core contribution is a minimal algebra and analysis that expose, rather than collapse, the structure of precision loss—yielding principled and explainable static diagnostics.
